# Create and Send Emails Using Data from Excel

I wanted to find a way to include data from an Excel workbook in the body of an email. This solution uses and SMTP server to send HTML emails. HTML emails allows you to include data from the Excel sheet as an HTML table in the body of the email.

This example will not function until you add settings specific to the mail server you plan to use, but it should take you in the right direction.
